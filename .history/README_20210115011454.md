#Official Hackathon Website 

## Deployment

When you are done with the setup, you should host your website online.
We highly recommend to read through the [Deploying on Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) docs for React.

#### Deploying to Netlify

You could also host directly with Netlify by linking your own repository.
